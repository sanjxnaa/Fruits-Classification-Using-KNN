# Fruits-Classification-Using-KNN
 Fruits Classification Machine Learning model by K Nearest Neighbors
 This was a community kaggle competition hosted by our ML professor.
 Datasets given were: fruits_train dataset given for training and test the implementation using fruits_test data set.
 Normalization of the data was done by sklearn.preprocessing module.
 Distance metric used here was the Euclidean Distance.
 KNN algorithm was to be implemented from scratch without the use of any external libraries like sklearn. The best K value was found to be 1 for the given dataset as it was a small dataset.
 
 Finally the classification accuracy obtained from this model was 0.777.
